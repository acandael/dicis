    <p>This research unit – already part of the HoMER Network – has two major funded research projects (by the Arts and Humanities Research Council &amp; British Academy Mid-Career Fellowship) which are strongly inspired by the NCH-perspective.</p>
    <p>One is on the historical film culture in Rome, including the construction of large databases on film programming, distribution and exploitation in the Italian capital.</p>
    <p>The other, more recent project is a replica (in terms of methodologies) on a much wider scale with historical cinemagoing research for a large sample of cities and regions in Italy.</p>
