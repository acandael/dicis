    <p>On the 1st of October 2014, Health, Media &amp; Society has been officially launched. In the next four years, our researchers will join efforts around the project "(De)constructing Health News". Drawing on a transdisciplinary partnership between communication sciences, sociolinguistics, medical science and sociology, this project is focused on the coverage of elderly-related health issues with the aim of investigating the impact of the changing mediascape. The research will be conducted by four PhD students under the supervision of 5 supervisors. The coordination of the project is in hands of Sarah Van Leuven.</p>
