    <p>DICIS - Digital Cinema Studies is a scientific research network funded by the Research Foundation Flanders with international expertise on film and cinema studies crossing over to digital humanities to understand the use, contribution and meaning of the digital turn for the field of cinema studies.</p>
    <p>At the crossroads of cinema studies and digital humanities, DICIS main goal is to gather expertise on re-purposable and generative digital discovery tools to fortify the methodology and conceptual base of the computational turn.</p>
    <p>DICIS stimulates international comparative research by looking into compatibility, comparability and open access of databases on international film historical research.</p>The network wants to strengthen existing scientific research collaborations within a core unit of the HoMER network working with digital tools and questions, expand the network to similar  research centers and increase the expertise concerning (historical/longitudinal) big cinema data.</p>
    <p>The Network has two Flemish partners and eight international partners, and organizes events, seminars, workshops and conference twice a year.</p>
